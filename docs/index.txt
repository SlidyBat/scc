:title: Shellcode Compiler Runtime

The Shellcode Compiler is a C compiler designed to output standalone code that will be injected into other
running processes.  It contains a small, lightweight runtime that is designed to generate small code.  The
runtime has absolutely no external dependencies other than the target operating system kernel, so the
generated code is not dependent on the target system's configuration.  It contains advanced features for
customizing the code generation to satisfy constraints and make code that is harder to reverse engineer.

* C syntax.
* Runtime is built-in to the compiler executable and does not need to be installed.
* Able to output ELF, Mach-O, and PE binaries in addition to flat position-independent binary blobs.
* Targets Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows.
* Supports both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures on all supported platforms.
* (Planned feature, only applies to padding currently) Blacklist any byte value, and the compiler will generate code that does not use it.  For example, it
can generate code that does not have null bytes.
* (Partially implemented, register and basic block ordering) Polymorphic code generation can generate different code each time it is compiled.
* Calling conventions (including the choice of stack pointer register) are highly customizable.
* Python bindings for dynamic generation of code from scripts.
