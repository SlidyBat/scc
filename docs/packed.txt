__packed
========
:title: Shellcode Compiler Runtime

---------------------------------------------
struct type __packed
{
	int member;
	...
};
---------------------------------------------

The `__packed` keyword disables alignment restrictions on a structure.  No padding will be added between members.

IMPORTANT: Be careful with this keyword on architectures that require aligned memory access.
