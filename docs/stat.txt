:title: Shellcode Compiler Runtime

---------------------------------------------
int stat(const char* path, struct stat* buf);
---------------------------------------------

Gets information about the file at path `path` and places it into `buf`.  If the file referenced is a symbolic
link, the lnk will be followed.  The contents of the `struct stat` structure vary by platform, but share many common fields:

* `st_uid`: User that owns the file
* `st_gid`: Group that owns the file
* `st_mode`: File access rights
* `st_size`: Size of file in bytes

The standard C runtime macros for checking `st_mode`, such as `S_ISDIR`, exist for all supported POSIX platforms.

Returns zero on success, or the negation of the error code on error.
