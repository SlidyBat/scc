---------------------------------------------
ssize_t write(int fd, const void* buf, size_t count);
---------------------------------------------

Writes `count` bytes from the buffer `buf` to the file handle `fd`.  Returns the number of bytes written, or
the negation of the error code on error.  It is possible for the number of bytes written to be smaller than the number
of bytes requested.

IMPORTANT: If the system call is interrupted, this function will return `-EINTR`.  This differs from most C runtimes,
where `-1` is returned with `errno` set to `EINTR`.  As this runtime does not have `errno`, callers should check
for `-EINTR` and a result less than zero in the error checking code.
